## What's new

Notes from our weekly R Spatial Workshop are now [**online**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) this quarter. Developed by Angela Li, these notes cover spatial data import, visualization, and analysis. Detailed writeups from each session are included, as well as links to scripts written in the workshops.

We hope this helps researchers who have to miss a session, or interested individuals who aren't able to join us in person. As always, you are welcome to attend our sessions, which take place at **Searle 240B** at noon on Tuesdays. Please contact Angela (contact information included in the [workshop notes](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/)) if you are interested in attending. 

We will be running another session of the study group in the spring, so don't worry if you are unable to make these workshops.
