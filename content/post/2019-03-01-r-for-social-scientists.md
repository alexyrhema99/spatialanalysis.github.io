## For our researchers

During my weekly R Spatial Workshop, I teach the basics of how to make maps and work with spatial data in R to researchers. The topics we cover are mainly GIS and visualization focused. However, researchers often need to work with data in ways outside of these two specific areas. Learning to clean and manipulate tabular data is a useful skill for many researchers as it allows them to work more efficiently.

As a certified Carpentries instructor, I'm teaching and organizing a **one-day R for Social Scientists** workshop on April 12 to social science researchers to get them up to speed with R. The goal is to give researchers enough support and familiarity with programming that they will be able to "get their work done in less time and with less pain", as described by the Carpentries. For our center, this is a way to reach out to the larger campus community and help social scientists develop research computing skills. 

## Attend the workshop

The curriculum for R for Social Scientists is open source and [**freely available online**](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), so feel free to work through the material and teach yourself if are unable to attend.

I encourage you to [**register**](https://angela-li.github.io/2019-04-12-chicago/) for the workshop, and please share this event with interested individuals!
