An outline of both workshop schedules is included below, with links to the [workshop notes](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) from each session. Specific skills covered at each workshop are subject to change, but the general outline of topics should remain the same.

Learn more about the R Spatial Workshop on our main [Events](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/events) page.
