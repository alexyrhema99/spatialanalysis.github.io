During the 2018-2019 school year, the Center for Spatial Data Science is piloting a R Spatial Workshop for researchers, students, and staff. The workshops are run by [Angela Li](https://twitter.com/CivicAngela), R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS. 

**New as of Spring 2019**: We are running two workshop tracks this quarter: GIS/Visualization and Raster/Kriging. The GIS/Visualization workshop runs from **10-11am on Wednesday at Searle 240B** and the Raster/Kriging workshop runs from **2-3pm** the same day and location. These workshops are open to the university community, as well as outsiders (please email Angela at ali6@uchicago.edu for more information). 

[Workshop notes and scripts](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) are posted online after each workshop, and serve as a record of what was covered at each workshop. These notes can also be used for self-study. [Workshop schedules](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/events/workshop-schedules) can also be found online.

Topics covered during the workshops include:

* Spatial data formats
* Projections
* Spatial data handling
* Spatial data operations
* Static maps
* Interactive maps
* Organization of research projects
* Reproducible research with R

Workshops are run at a beginner level, but previous experience with R is encouraged. Future workshops may delve into R packages for spatial econometrics and regression, such as `spatstat` and `spdep`. Please [join the CSDS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csds-study-group) for weekly updates regarding the workshop.
