During Fall 2018, the Center for Spatial Data Science is piloting a R Spatial Workshop for researchers, students, and staff. The workshops are run by [Angela Li](https://twitter.com/CivicAngela), R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS.

Workshops are from **noon-1pm** on Tuesdays at Searle 240B, and are open to the university community. Please [join the CSDS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csds-study-group) for more information.

Topics covered during the workshops include:

* Using Git + R
* Data manipulation and visualization with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`
* Spatial data manipulation with `sf`
* Mapping with `leaflet`
* Cartography with `tmap`

Workshops are run at a beginner level, but previous experience with R is encouraged. Future workshops may delve into R packages for spatial econometrics and regression, such as `spatstat` and `spdep`.
