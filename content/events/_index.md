For Fall 2019, Angela Li is running an Introduction to Spatial Data Science in R workshop that runs concurrently with the Introduction to Spatial Data Science course taught by Luc Anselin and Marynia Kolak in the College. The workshop runs from **noon-1pm on Tuesday at Searle 240A**. These workshops are open to the university community, as well as outsiders (please email Angela at ali6@uchicago.edu for more information). 

[Workshop notes and scripts](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) are posted online after each workshop, and serve as a record of what was covered at each workshop. These notes can also be used for self-study. [Workshop schedules](../../events/workshop-schedules) can also be found online.

Workshops are run at a beginner level, but previous experience with R is encouraged. Please [join the CSDS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csds-study-group) for weekly updates regarding the workshop.
