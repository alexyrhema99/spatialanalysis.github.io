During the 2018-2019 school year, the Center for Spatial Data Science piloted the R Spatial Workshop for researchers, students, and staff. The workshops were run by [Angela Li](https://twitter.com/CivicAngela), R Spatial Advocate for the CSDS. An outline of the workshops that were held are included below, with links to the [workshop notes](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) from each session.

Topics covered during the workshops included:

* Spatial data formats
* Projections
* Spatial data handling
* Spatial data operations
* Static maps
* Interactive maps
* Organization of research projects
* Reproducible research with R

Find the current quarter's workshops on our main [Events](../../events) page.
