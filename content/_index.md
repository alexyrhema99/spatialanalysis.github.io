title: Learn Spatial Analysis
---

The [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago is currently in the process of developing this site to share tutorials and resources for spatial analysis. In particular, we are working to put together a [comprehensive set of R tutorials](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/) to teach concepts such as spatial regression, spatial autocorrelation, and more.

In addition to these online resources, we are hosting weekly [research computing workshops](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/events/) for researchers and interested individuals at the UChicago campus.

Please check back frequently as this site will be updated as we develop new resources!
