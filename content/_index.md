title: Learn Spatial Analysis
---

The [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago is currently in the process of developing this site to share tutorials and resources for spatial analysis in R. This is an initiative started by Luc Anselin and currently led by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate for the center. 

Our projects include:

- Putting together a comprehensive set of [**tutorials**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/) to teach concepts such as exploratory spatial data analysis, mapping, spatial regression, spatial autocorrelation, and more
- Hosting weekly [**workshops**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/events/) for researchers and interested individuals at the UChicago campus to learn R. [**Notes**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/workshop-notes/) from these workshops can be used for self-study to gain a basic understanding of spatial data in the R ecosystem.
- Contributing to open source spatial packages in R, improving documentation for common packages, and developing new software where functionalities are missing.

Please check back frequently as this site will be updated while we develop new resources!
