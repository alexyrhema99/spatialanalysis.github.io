## Introduction to Spatial Data Science

Below are the R lab notes from Luc Anselin's [Introduction to Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/content/lectures-luc-anselin-uchicago) course at the University of Chicago. These labs mirror the [GeoDa notebooks](http://geodacenter.github.io/documentation.html), but use R rather than GeoDa.

* [**Spatial Data Handling**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/1_R_Spatial_Data_Handling.html): Import, manipulate, and map abandoned vehicle data to make a choropleth map of abandoned vehicles per capita for Chicago community areas.
* [**Exploratory Data Analysis 1 - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/2_R_EDA_1.html): Explore NYC socioeconomic data by borough and perform exploratory spatial analysis involving univariate plots, smoothing methods, and linear fits.
* [**Exploratory Data Analysis 2 - Multivariate Exploration**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/3_R_EDA_2.html): Continue to explore NYC socioeconomic data using spatial data analysis methods for three or more variables, including scatter plots, bubble plots, and parallel coordinate plots.
* [**Basic Mapping**](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/4_R_Mapping.html): Finish working with NYC socioeconomic data by creating and customizing a variety of maps, including choropleth maps, conditional maps, and cartograms.
