      <description>Who we are Led by Luc Anselin, we&amp;rsquo;re a group of students, staff, and faculty at the University of Chicago who use spatial methods in our research and teaching. As spatial thinkers, we’re excited to launch this site to teach introductory spatial analysis.
Over the next few months, we plan to build out teaching materials based off of Luc Anselin’s spatial data courses at the University of Chicago. Our goal is to demonstrate how you can get started with exploratory spatial data analysis, including spatial dependence and spatial modeling.</description>
