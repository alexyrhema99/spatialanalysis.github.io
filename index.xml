      <title>R for Social Scientists One-Day Workshop Offered</title>

      <description>For our researchers During my weekly R Spatial Workshop, I teach the basics of how to make maps and work with spatial data in R to researchers. The topics we cover are mainly GIS and visualization focused. However, researchers often need to work with data in ways outside of these two specific areas. Learning to clean and manipulate tabular data is a useful skill for many researchers as it allows them to work more efficiently.</description>

      <title>R Spatial Workshop Notes Posted Online</title>
      <link>https://spatialanalysis.github.io/post/workshop-notes-online/</link>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s new Notes from our weekly R Spatial Workshop are now online this quarter. Developed by Angela Li, these notes cover spatial data import, visualization, and analysis. Detailed writeups from each session are included, as well as links to scripts written in the workshops.
We hope this helps researchers who have to miss a session, or interested individuals who aren&amp;rsquo;t able to join us in person. As always, you are welcome to attend our sessions, which take place at Searle 240B at noon on Tuesdays.</description>

      <title>Launching Spatial Analysis Site</title>
      <link>https://spatialanalysis.github.io/post/launching-spatial-analysis-site/</link>

      <guid>https://spatialanalysis.github.io/post/launching-spatial-analysis-site/</guid>
      <description>Who we are Led by Luc Anselin, we&amp;rsquo;re a group of students, staff, and faculty at the University of Chicago who use spatial methods in our research and teaching. As spatial thinkers, we’re excited to launch this site to teach introductory spatial analysis.
Over the next few months, we plan to build out teaching materials based off of Luc Anselin’s spatial data courses at the University of Chicago. Our goal is to demonstrate how you can get started with exploratory spatial data analysis, including spatial dependence and spatial modeling.</description>
