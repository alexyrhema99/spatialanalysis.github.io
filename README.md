This repository holds the source code for the Spatial Analysis website developed by the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago. It is built using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

## About 
This website was developed through the efforts of Luc Anselin, Grant Morrison, and Angela Li. Questions and feedback can be directed to us by [filing an issue](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/spatialanalysis.github.io/issues) in this repository.

### About the Center for Spatial Data Science
A joint initiative of the [Division of Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu) and the [Computation Institute](https://www.ci.uchicago.edu), the Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS) develops state-of-the-art methods for geospatial analysis, spatial econometrics, and geo-visualization; implements them through open source software tools; applies them to policy-relevant research in the social sciences; and disseminates them through training and support to a growing worldwide community of over 200,000 spatial analysts. As of July 1, 2016, CSDS succeeds the GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation at Arizona State University.

### Quick Tips for Updating This Site

**Note: Don't track or commit the `public` folder on the hugo branch!** 

After making changes on the `hugo` branch, committing, and pushing them, run 
```
bash deploy.sh
```
to update the site. There's a nasty combination of Github subtrees and branches underlying this site, because Hugo doesn't work super well with Github pages.

- When in doubt, edit `config.toml`, for sitewide settings like the website title, headers, and footers.
- To update page content, add to the `content` folder. 
- To update page formatting, go to the `layouts` folder. You can copy and modify the original HTML layout files from `themes/hugo-smorg/layouts`.
- **Don't edit the `public` folder!** (The stuff in there is automatically generated from the files in `content`.) 
- Images for pages and posts as well as logo files are stored in the `static` folder. Use the RStudio `blogdown` addin to insert images easily.
- To include a pure `html` file, add it to the `static/html` folder, and link to it with `html/name-of-file.html`

If things are going awry, uncomment `setup.sh` and run it, then follow the same process as detailed above.
